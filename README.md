## Description
This program is a practice trading platform for cryptocurrency. The user can buy or sell cryptocurrency with a practice account funded with “practice money”. ShoCoWo features live updated 30 day graphs. Additionally, prices quoted before the purchase or sell are pulled live from the internet via API. 

## System Requirements
Any computer or laptop with internet browser IE 11, Chrome ver.52 or higher will be able to access and successfully run ShoCoWo.

## Installation
ShoCoWo is an internet based application. No installation is required on the local machine provided it has internet access. 

## Operating Instructions
When a user accesses the home page of ShoCoWo they are required to create an account by registering their email as the user name and creating a password. Once registered the user can log into the sight. The new user is provided with $50,000 of “practice money” to buy or sell cryptocurrency to make a purchase the user simply clicks either the “trade” button under Bitcoin or Ethereum images or click one of the buttons at the top in the navigation bar. This will take the user to a buy or sell page where the user simply inserts the amount they wish to buy or sell and clicks the button. Once the purchase or sale is made, the user is redirected to that cryptocurrency’s graph page where the buy or sell is logged on the right side of the screen along with current information regarding the user’s various wallet balances.
